Improvements: 
  1) We can remove the search button from the input as the lists can be filtered based upon users input. This reduces unnecessary code and gives a better experience for user.
  2) We can have a close icon on the input so that when user wants to clear the text, user need not press bakspace multiple times.
  3) We can allow user to search for topics case-insensitive. This allows user to search without actually bothering about the casing.
